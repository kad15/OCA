	abstract = { This paper describes an exact algorithm capable of solving large-scale instances of the well-known uncapacitated hub location problem with multiple assignments. The algorithm applies Benders decomposition to a strong path-based formulation of the problem. The standard decomposition algorithm is enhanced through the inclusion of several features such as the use of a multicut reformulation, the generation of strong optimality cuts, the integration of reduction tests, and the execution of a heuristic procedure. Extensive computational experiments were performed to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm. Computational results obtained on classical benchmark instances (with up to 200 nodes) and on a new and more difficult set of instances (with up to 500 nodes) confirm the efficiency of the algorithm. }

	abstract = { This paper proposes methodology for improving the performance of Benders decomposition when applied to mixed integer programs. It introduces a new technique for accelerating the convergence of the algorithm and theory for distinguishing “good” model formulations of a problem that has distinct but equivalent mixed integer programming representations. The acceleration technique is based upon selecting judiciously from the alternate optima of the Benders subproblem to generate strong or pareto-optimal cuts. This methodology also applies to a much broader class of optimization algorithms that includes Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for linear and nonlinear programs and related “cutting plane” type algorithms that arise in resource directive and price decomposition. When specialized to network location problems, this cut generation technique leads to very efficient algorithms that exploit the underlying structure of these models. In discussing the “proper” formulation of mixed integer programs, we suggest criteria for comparing various mixed integer formulations of a problem and for choosing formulations that can provide stronger cuts for Benders decomposition. From this discussion intimate connections between the previously disparate viewpoints of strong Benders cuts and tight linear programming relaxations of integer programs emerge. }
